# User List Demo // For Zinobe

## Overview

This is an example of a simple application built with Angular using a user sample API. All the actions are simulated due API limitations.

### Requirements

- Node.js 8+
- NPM
- Angular CLI
  `npm install -g @angular/cli@1.7.4`

### Description

This is an example of a simple application built with Angular and the SASS preprocessor. It can run standalone with the `ng serve` command. It's an example of a Single Page Application (SPA), where the different views within a single index.html page are dynamically loaded by the Angular framework.

Here are the key features illustrated in the sample:

* The three different views (list, details, and about) are separate Angular components loaded, configured in app.module.ts.
* [Angular Http](https://angular.io/api/http/Http) is used to load the API.
* SASS preprocessor without frameworks is used for styling of the application UI.

### Install

To set up this sample:

1. Download and unzip this [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) repository.
2. Install project dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Run with `ng serve`.
